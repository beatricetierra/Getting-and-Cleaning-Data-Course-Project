# Getting-and-Cleaning-Data-Course-Project

This project is the final course project for the Getting and Cleaning Data course.
In this repository you will find the (1) Human Activity Recognition Using Smartphones Data Sets provided by UCI, under the 'UCI HAR Dataset' folder, the (2) run_analysis.R script, and the (3) CodeBook.md file. 
The run_analysis.R script takes all the separate data from the UCI HAR Datasets, and merges them into one tidy dataframe that can be used for further analysis. The methods used to achieve the final tidy dataframe is outlined in the CodeBook.md file.
